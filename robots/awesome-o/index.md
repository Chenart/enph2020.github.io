![A purple 3D-printed hemispherical skid for the front of our robot. When flipped upside-down, the countersunk boltholes resemble eyes on a face, so angry eyebrows and a mouth were drawn on it with a black sharpie. The skid is held against a backdrop of MVP members reattaching the arm to the chassis.][angry purple skid]

![A white 3D-printed hemispherical skid for the front of our robot, with about a quarter of the hemisphere sliced off perpendicular to its base. When flipped upside-down, the bolts through the skid resemble eyes on a face and the sliced off plane resembles a mouth, so angry eyebrows were drawn on it with a blue marker. The skid is resting on a heavily cratered black surface.][angry white skid]
