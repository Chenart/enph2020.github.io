During the ENPH 253 Robot Design Competition, our team designed, built and deployed an autonomous robot tasked with navigating an obstacle course. The robot was tasked with passing through an alarmed door, traversing a narrow ramp, then retrieving six plastic toys from a large tub and deploying them down a zipline. Over the course of 6 weeks, we were able to produce a working robot which could overcome all aspects of this course.

The document below outlines the specifications of our robot, as well as the design and manufacturing process which made our robot a success. The document has been divided into three main categories; mechanical, electrical, and software.

If you happen to be a current ENPH 253 student and are reading this report, out of respect for the competition and the work which we put into this project, please do not use any of the ideas outlined in this document without giving proper reference to its conceivers.
