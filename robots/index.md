## Mission Impossible 8: Rogue Squishies

Sixteen teams of second-year Engineering Physics students have built self-driving cars to rescue six trapped secret agents by avoiding an alarmed door, scaling a narrow ramp, and rescuing the agents from a tank filled with water and sending the agents back to safety on a zipline. This is the 17th annual Engineering Physics robot competition!
