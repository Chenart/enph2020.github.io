Welcome to the project page of reneZ the robot! ReneZ was built by a group of 2nd year Engineering Physics students at the University of British Columbia, to compete in the 2017 ENPH 253 "Mission Impossi-Bots" Robot Competition.

In designing our robot, we strived for simplicity, robustness, and consistency. Rather than relying on an abundance of sensors, processing, and complex algorithms, we aimed to create a cleverly designed robot that successfully completes tasks by its intrinsic mechanical design.
