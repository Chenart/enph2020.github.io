We used the cloud-based CAD software [Onshape][] for all of our CAD modelling, which allowed us to design components collaboratively. By using laser cut pieces of 1/8" hardboard for the majority of our mechanical components, we were able to quickly make prototypes of our ideas and test many design iterations prior to integration.
